/**
  * The Observable interface that implements the Reactive Pattern.
  *
  * @define subscribeObserverMain
  * Call this method to subscribe an [[ObserverFacade]] for receiving
  * items and notifications from the Observable.
  *
  * A typical implementation of `subscribe` does the following:
  *
  * It stores a reference to the Observer in a collection object, such as a `List[T]` object.
  *
  * It returns a reference to the [[Subscription]] interface. This enables Observers to
  * unsubscribe, that is, to stop receiving items and notifications before the Observable stops
  * sending them, which also invokes the Observer's onCompleted method.
  *
  * An `Observable[T]` instance is responsible for accepting all subscriptions
  * and notifying all Observers. Unless the documentation for a particular
  * `Observable[T]` implementation indicates otherwise, Observers should make no
  * assumptions about the order in which multiple Observers will receive their notifications.
  * @define subscribeObserverParamObserver
  * the observer
  * @define subscribeObserverParamScheduler
  * the [[rxscalajs.Scheduler]] on which Observers subscribe to the Observable
  * @define subscribeSubscriberParamObserver
  * the [[rxscalajs.subscription.Subscriber]]
  * @define subscribeSubscriberParamScheduler
  * the [[rxscalajs.Scheduler]] on which [[rxscalajs.subscription.Subscriber]]s subscribe to the Observable
  * @define subscribeAllReturn
  * a [[rxscalajs.subscription.Subscription]] reference whose `unsubscribe` method can be called to  stop receiving items
  * before the Observable has finished sending them
  * @define subscribeCallbacksMainWithNotifications
  * Call this method to receive items and notifications from this observable.
  * @define subscribeCallbacksMainNoNotifications
  * Call this method to receive items from this observable.
  * @define subscribeCallbacksParamOnNext
  * this function will be called whenever the Observable emits an item
  * @define subscribeCallbacksParamOnError
  * this function will be called if an error occurs
  * @define subscribeCallbacksParamOnComplete
  * this function will be called when this Observable has finished emitting items
  * @define subscribeCallbacksParamScheduler
  * the scheduler to use
  * @define noDefaultScheduler
  * ===Scheduler:===
  * This method does not operate by default on a particular [[Scheduler]].
  * @define supportBackpressure
  * ===Backpressure:===
  * Fully supports backpressure.

    *
    * Takes an Observable of Observables, and collects all Observables from it.
    * Once the outer Observable completes, it subscribes to all collected
    * Observables and combines their values using the {@link combineLatest}
    * strategy, such that:
    * - Every time an inner Observable emits, the output Observable emits.
    * - When the returned observable emits, it emits all of the latest values by:
    *   - If a `project` function is provided, it is called with each recent value
    * from each inner Observable in whatever order they arrived, and the result
    * of the `project` function is what is emitted by the output Observable.
    *   - If there is no `project` function, an array of all of the most recent
    * values is emitted by the output Observable.
    *
    * @example <caption>Map two click events to a finite interval Observable, then apply combineAll</caption>
    *          {{{ var clicks = Observable.fromEvent(document, "click")

    * @param project
    * a function that combines the items from the Observable and the Iterable to generate
    * the items to be emitted by the resulting Observable
